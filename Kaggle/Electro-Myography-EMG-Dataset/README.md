All of the folders contain data, you might want to choose based on what kind you need.
Some folders contain Raw emg data and some contain extracted features
Every folder contains more readme files explaining stuff so be sure to read them.

Note: Raw data folders might contain a little less samples because some of them were deleted...sorry for that
And if you dont understand my features or formats work with the raw_emg_data_unprocessed. It contains the data in its original form. Electrodes along x-axis (columns) and wave data points along y-axis (rows).
